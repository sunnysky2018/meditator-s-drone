					<h4 id="aboutme">About Me</h4>
					<p>Although there are stories about meditators progressing to the stream entry, second path, or even the fourth path in a couple of, or a few years,
             most people, including me, practice on and off for years. Although I accept the fact that we all have good and bad days for practicing,
						 I want to find something that is better than just struggling with the question of whether to continue or to give up. </p>

          <p>This is how I see this. It is like climbing up a mountain. There are different hindrances on the way. Some people don't like steep slopes but okay with
             muddy roads, while some people doing the opposite. So if you are following, for example, Culadasa's ten stages, you find the progress is not linear throught
						 all the stages, and different people have different patterns to progress. </p>
					<p>While Culadasa's ten stages are THE most clearly explained method that I have ever found, and have been used by me as my backbone of practice,
             I found that it helps a lot by supplementing it with other books or methods. Especially when I feel I am not progressing or even regressing, or need
						 some motivation and incentive. Just like when you encounter steep slopes that you don't like, you may find another way up. And after your bypass that part,
						 you can always come back to your original path if you would like. </p>
						 <img src="images/route-1952-swiss.jpg" alt="mountain2" />
					<p>One typical question is like this: "I am practicing stage 4 of TMI and got stuck. Is there any other books/talks/methods that can help?"
						In other words, how to compare one method to another. Which book or chapter of a book matches the certain stage of another book? There is no easy answer.
						In fact, I don't think there exists a way to 'convert' those methods. Because everyone is different.
					</p>
					<p>However, I do think it helps if you know what methods work for those who are practicing approximately the same stage/methods as you do.
						That is the basic idea of "Meditator's Drone": people checked in what practice they do, and they can see the collective statistics of checking-ins of
						different levels of other people.
					</p>

					<p>In other words, my goal is to provide a tool to give 360 degree views of different meditation methods as paths to the "ancient city".</p>
          <p>So whenever you feel frustrated with your practice, you can check out other practice or methods to bypass it. If you are on the train or waiting for bus or have ten minutes
						to relax, you can check out an off cushion practice or a reflection. There is no more pressure or pushing.
					</p>
					<p>To avoid copyright issues, I cannot upload contents of any books here. But if you own that book, you can make private notes for yourself to view.
					</p>
					<p>Being a novice meditator, I have read very limited number of books and have not tried many methods. So if there are methods that you have tried but are
						not listed here, please use the following form to contact me. If you have signed up an account, let me know your account name, and I will make your account an editor. Thank you! </p>
